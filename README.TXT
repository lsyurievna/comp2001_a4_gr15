NOTE FROM LIUDMILA:
This is a very imperfect version that I hope to improve in the future as I carefully
go through Chapters 15 and 16 of the book. Student and Instructor can be made subclasses 
of Actor class. A million more modifications and assumptions shoud be made before the 
program is considered serious but some basic functionality is achieved in this version.
